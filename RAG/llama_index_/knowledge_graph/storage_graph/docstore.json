professional baseball team based in Philadelphia.The Phillies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) East division.Since 2004, the team's home stadium has been Citizens Bank Park, located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.The Phillies have won two World Series championships (against the Kansas City Royals in 1980 and the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008), eight National League pennants (the first of which came in 1915), and made 15 playoff appearances.As of November 6, 2022, the team has played 21,209 games, winning 10,022 games and losing 11,187.Since the first modern World Series was played in 1903, the Phillies have played 120 consecutive seasons and 140 seasons since the team's 1883 establishment.The Phillies were the last of the 16 pre-expansion teams to win a World Series, with their first championship coming in 1980.Since the start of the Divisional Era in 1969, however, the Phillies have emerged as one of MLB's most successful teams, winning 11 division titles (including five consecutive such titles from 2007 to 2011), eight National League pennants, and two World Series championships.The franchise was founded in Philadelphia in 1883, replacing the team from Worcester, Massachusetts, in the National League.The team has played at several stadiums in the city, beginning with Recreation Park (1883\u20131886) and continuing at Baker Bowl (1887\u20131938); Shibe Park (which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953 in honor of the longtime Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack) (1938\u20131970); Veterans Stadium (1971\u20132003), and now Citizens Bank Park (2004\u2013present).Because of, and in spite of, their longevity and rabid fan base, the Phillies are a team historically associated with futility.They were the first American sports franchise to amass over 10,000 losses; the team holds the world record for most ever losses by a single team in all of professional sports.Yet, also due in part to their longevity, the Phillies are one of only nine teams to have won over 10,000 games in their history.Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt is widely considered the franchise's greatest player of all time.Over the team's history since 1883, 33 Phillies players have been awarded entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.The Philadelphia Phillies' Triple-A affiliate is the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, who play at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"},

baseball player) and attorney John Rogers won an expansion National League franchise for Philadelphia, one of what is now known as the \"Classic Eight\" of the National League. They were awarded a spot in the league to replace the Worcester baseball team, a franchise that had folded in 1882. The new team was nicknamed the \"Phillies\" from the start, and immediately compiled a .173 winning percentage, which stands as the worst in franchise history. Although many sources (including the Phillies themselves) claim that Reach and Rogers bought the Brown Stockings and moved them to Philadelphia, all available evidence suggests this is not the case. Significantly, no players from Worcester ended up with the 1883 Quakers.In 1884, Harry Wright, the former manager of baseball's first openly professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was recruited as a manager in hopes of reversing the team's fortunes.In 1887, the team began to play at the newly constructed Philadelphia Base Ball Grounds, later renamed National League Park. The stadium would become known as Baker Bowl in 1923.

Murphy, at first refused to let the Phillies out of their lease.He finally relented in 1938, and only then because the city threatened to condemn the dilapidated park.Despite the move, attendance rarely topped 3,000 a game.The lowest point came in 1941, when the Phillies finished with a 43\u2013111 record, setting a franchise record for losses in a season.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a352eda-6800-48f7-935e-bb71eb7449b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a352eda-6800-48f7-935e-bb71eb7449b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "539469fa-4440-4986-8b5e-f7085e8bdbd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "866533a7ff84784688f6aa969f1e9703f835861cfd26eb907088c7ef828f9ef7"}, "2": {"node_id": "96ea8033-5641-4f6d-8a0c-7409a9ee0f61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec037b82562bb6d778252ff7215f35160d6d1ba54c886145825d895bf025a334"}, "3": {"node_id": "33833876-533c-4637-b62a-3e2b0e4f50d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b806eba1faab921b5f65dbc6b8da21f69c7b1c283e69be3d3df629063d609a73"}}, "hash": "b1c6f01a6f091cbc81a93dec64a0988f6263815b2653dcd06e3bb41a2ddb8ccb", "text": "A year later, they needed an advance from the league just to go to spring training.Nugent realized he did not have enough money to operate the team in 1943, and put it up for sale.After lumber baron William D.

Management chose \"Blue Jays\", the fan submission of Elizabeth Crooks, who received a $100 war bond as compensation. The Phillies would later claim in the 2000s that the Blue Jays moniker was never official, however news reports in 1944 note that Phillies management said that the Blue Jays name was as an official \"additional nickname\", meaning that the team had two official nicknames simultaneously, the Phillies and the Blue Jays.The Phillies' official adoption of Blue Jays as a second official nickname led to a dispute with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, whose nickname is and was Blue Jays. Wilson Shaffer, the school's athletic director, criticized the Philadelphia team for adopting his university's moniker, and said that Philadelphia should use the blue jay's scientific name instead and be known as the Philadelphia Cyanocitta Cristata. Similarly, the university's student council, citing the Philadelphia team's long track record of failure, passed a resolution demanding \"suitable satisfaction\" for what they perceived as theft and sullying of the Blue Jays name. Carpenter, Jr., responded by criticizing Johns Hopkins' baseball record and promised to make the students proud of the Blue Jays name by having his Philadelphia baseball team win many games.The Philadelphia team added three minor league clubs before the start of the 1946 season and named them all Blue Jays: the Class C Salina Blue Jays, Class C Schenectady Blue Jays and Class D Green Bay Blue Jays. \nHowever, the new Blue Jays moniker was ultimately unpopular, and although the team in the 2000s claimed that it was quietly dropped by 1949, news reports at the time indicate that the nickname, which \"never caught on anyway\", was not officially dropped by the team until January 1950.Coincidentally, the Phillies would play a team called the Blue Jays (who wasn't based in Philadelphia but in Toronto) in the 1993 World Series with the defending world champion Blue Jays winning in six games.\n(The Blue Jays moniker would be used by Toronto's MLB club when it started play

most of the first half of the 20th century.Even though the A's had fielded teams as bad or worse than the Phillies for most years since the 1930s, the A's continued to trounce the Phillies at the gate.However, a series of poor baseball and business decisions on the A's part allowed the Phillies to win the hearts of Philadelphia's long-suffering fans.Things started coming together for the Phillies in 1949, when they rocketed up the standings to third place with an 81\u201373 record.Although the season had essentially been a two-team race between Brooklyn and St. Louis, it was still the Phillies' first appearance in the first division in 31 years.It was also a fitting tribute to Bob Carpenter Sr., who had died in June and left Bob Jr. in full control of the team.The 1950 Phillies led the National League standings for most of the season and were dubbed the \"Whiz Kids\".In the final months of the season, a tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting pitcher Curt Simmons to National

the Brooklyn Dodgers clinched the Phillies' first pennant in 35 years.In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and victims of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York

In 1979, the Phillies acquired Pete Rose, the spark that would put them over the top.\n\n\n==== 1980 World Series champions ====\n\nThe Phillies won the National League East in 1980, but to win the league championship, they had to defeat the Houston Astros.In a memorable NLCS, with four of the five games needing extra innings, they fell behind 2\u20131 but battled back to squeeze past the Astros on a 10th-inning game-winning hit by center fielder Garry Maddox, and the city celebrated its first NL pennant in 30 years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d86c80a3-88ef-4ea3-81dc-8a1e9d1e9704": {"__data__": {"id_": "d86c80a3-88ef-4ea3-81dc-8a1e9d1e9704", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "539469fa-4440-4986-8b5e-f7085e8bdbd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "866533a7ff84784688f6aa969f1e9703f835861cfd26eb907088c7ef828f9ef7"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ace1e21-3610-4c44-ab8e-8858fd122980", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "61b610c589658d2311ae773639d8b1f9fed876ebc288e90c1ec48c7976b9edbe"}, "3": {"node_id": "6945dacf-928e-41c2-912e-581d06be416c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2dbcdec3e273de8709293888f3c0cf4f06c04838db06c5b30a18560709a877d"}}, "hash": "fbfc6d45107fe64c6bea61cba92192f45397e74ff52386a3a983f994fedc5552", "text": "The entire series saw only one home run hit, a game-winning two-run home run by Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski in the Phillies' opening 3\u20131 win in Game 1 at Philadelphia.Facing the Kansas City Royals in the 1980 World Series, the Phillies won their first World Series championship ever in six games thanks to the timely hitting of Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose.Schmidt, who won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1980, also won the World Series Most Valuable Player award on the strength of his 8-for-21 hitting (.381 average), including game-winning hits in Game 2 and the clinching Game 6.This final game was also significant because it remains \"the most-watched game in World Series history\" with a television audience of 54.9 million viewers.Thus, the Phillies became the last of the 16 teams that made up the Major Leagues from 1903 to 1960 to win a World Series.Carlton captured his third NL Cy Young Award with a record of 24\u20139.After their series win, Ruly Carpenter, who had been given control of the team in 1972 when his father stepped down as team president, sold the team for $32.5 million in 1981 to a group that was headed by longtime Phillies executive Bill Giles.The Phillies returned to the playoffs in 1981, which were split in half due to a players' strike.In five games, they were defeated in the first-ever National League Division Series by the Montreal Expos.Mike Schmidt won his second consecutive NL Most Valuable Player award that year.In 1982, the team finished three games behind the St. Louis Cardinals in the East Division, narrowly missing the playoffs.Carlton captured his fourth career NL Cy Young Award that year with 23 wins.For the 1983 season, the Phillies returned to the playoffs and beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.They won this series in four games to capture their fourth NL pennant; however, they lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series in five games.John Denny was named the 1983 NL Cy Young Award winner.Because of the numerous veterans on the 1983 team, Philadelphia Daily News sportswriter Stan Hochman gave them the nickname, the \"Wheeze Kids\".In 1984, the team finished fourth in the NL East with a record of 81\u201381.Mike Schmidt still remained a dominant force on the team by leading the National League in both home runs and runs batted in.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6945dacf-928e-41c2-912e-581d06be416c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6945dacf-928e-41c2-912e-581d06be416c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "539469fa-4440-4986-8b5e-f7085e8bdbd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "866533a7ff84784688f6aa969f1e9703f835861cfd26eb907088c7ef828f9ef7"}, "2": {"node_id": "d86c80a3-88ef-4ea3-81dc-8a1e9d1e9704", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fbfc6d45107fe64c6bea61cba92192f45397e74ff52386a3a983f994fedc5552"}, "3": {"node_id": "6cbe2cee-d847-4e43-af1b-87c8471f2215", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b0a25d55936cc62b1ea38d7c59ef7b7d464bc92885d916561416963978d3a24"}}, "hash": "e2dbcdec3e273de8709293888f3c0cf4f06c04838db06c5b30a18560709a877d", "text": "=== Years of struggle (1985\u20131991) ===\nThe 1985 season was the first time the team finished below .500 since 1974.

Atlanta.In the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft the Phillies selected pitcher Aaron Nola with the 7th overall pick.The team could not gain momentum during the season and finished last in the NL East,

be departing.Sandberg resigned as manager and bench coach Pete Mackanin was brought in as interim manager.Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs 5\u20130 at Wrigley Field, on July 25, striking out 13 and giving up only two walks.It was the first no-hitter against the Cubs since Sandy Koufax's perfect game in 1965, and first at Wrigley Field since the Cubs' Milt Pappas in 1972.Hamels was dealt to the Texas Rangers, six days later.The following month saw the departure of Chase Utley who was traded to the Dodgers.In September, general manager Rub\u00e9n Amaro Jr. was fired and Andy MacPhail was brought in as the interim general manager.The team once again finished last in the NL East with a record of 63\u201399.McPhail was officially named the organization's President of Baseball Operations

A dark burgundy was adopted as the main team color, with a classic pinstripe style for home uniforms. Blue was almost entirely dropped as part of the team's official color scheme, except in one area; a pale blue (as opposed to traditional grey) was used as the base-color for away game uniforms from 1972 to 1988. Yet the most important aspect of the 1970 uniform change was the adoption of one of the more distinctive logos in sports; a Phillies \"P\" that, thanks to its unique shape and \"baseball stitched\" center swirl, remained instantly recognizable and admired, long after its regular use had ended. It was while wearing this uniform style and color motif that the club achieved its most enduring success, including a World Series title in 1980 and another World Series appearance in 1983. Its continued popularity with fans is still evident. Even today, Phillies' home games can contain many fans sporting caps, shirts, and/or jackets emblazoned with the iconic \"P\" and burgundy color scheme. The current team has worn the burgundy and powder blue throwbacks whenever their opponents are wearing throwback uniforms from that era. Additionally, this uniform also marked the first appearance of \"racing stripes\" on a baseball uniform (striping going down the jersey shoulders, the side of the pants and up to the sides of the jersey up to the armpit), which would be seen on several other MLB teams for the next quarter-century.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c53e3c8-09e5-4043-815f-cba00efde310": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c53e3c8-09e5-4043-815f-cba00efde310", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "539469fa-4440-4986-8b5e-f7085e8bdbd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "866533a7ff84784688f6aa969f1e9703f835861cfd26eb907088c7ef828f9ef7"}, "2": {"node_id": "e54e918c-6077-4d85-87db-a89c7878716d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3e7328bd12606af2e112395268a100fdb2c638256c1d40f2fc58e052f30aed4"}, "3": {"node_id": "d0ff5552-0a08-443d-8241-62f794d012c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "efc98d43ac258faac8c9ab4ac55318feb92cafca788e43741d1170ec93300c15"}}, "hash": "6095ac8645596a7541e211a794461cfd76eadd465d962dd6b67cc51a43521e23", "text": "=== Controversial uniform changes ===\nIn 1979, the Phillies' front office modified the uniform into an all-burgundy version with white trimmings, to be worn for Saturday games. They were called \"Saturday Night Specials\" and were worn for the first and last time on May 19, 1979,  a 10\u20135 loss to the Montreal Expos. The immediate reaction of the media, fans, and players alike was negative, with many describing the despised uniforms as pajama-like. As such, the idea was hastily abandoned. Mike Schmidt did wear the uniform during the MLB All-Star Tour of Japan following the 1979 season. During the closing ceremonies at Veterans Stadium on September 28, 2003, there was a procession of former players during the post-game ceremony, most in uniform. Larry Christenson, the starting pitcher in the original game, came out wearing this old burgundy uniform, and was the only one to do so. The Phillies wore this jersey again for the 40th anniversary of the original game on July 27, 2019. Christenson threw out the ceremonial first pitch. They lost to the Atlanta Braves 15\u20137.Another uniform controversy arose in 1994, when the Phillies introduced all-blue caps on Opening Day that were to be worn for home day games only. The caps were unpopular with the players, who considered them bad luck after two losses and wanted them discontinued. Management wanted to keep using the caps as planned, as they sold well to fans. A compromise was reached: the players agreed to wear them for weekday games while returning to the customary red caps for Sunday afternoon games. In all, the Phillies wore the \"unlucky\" blue caps for seven games in 1994, losing six (the lone victory a 5\u20132 triumph over the Florida Marlins on June 29). A slightly different blue cap (with a red bill) was introduced in 2008 as part of the alternate home uniform for day games, a throwback to the late 1940s.\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\nThe Phillies had several notable rivalries through history as they often clashed frequently against the Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers during the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and the 2000s. The Phillies often faced heated postseason matchups against both teams, meeting the Dodgers five times in the NLCS; while also meeting the Braves twice in the NLDS and once in the NLCS.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0ff5552-0a08-443d-8241-62f794d012c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0ff5552-0a08-443d-8241-62f794d012c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "539469fa-4440-4986-8b5e-f7085e8bdbd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "866533a7ff84784688f6aa969f1e9703f835861cfd26eb907088c7ef828f9ef7"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c53e3c8-09e5-4043-815f-cba00efde310", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6095ac8645596a7541e211a794461cfd76eadd465d962dd6b67cc51a43521e23"}, "3": {"node_id": "944ed052-5e20-4b36-85a8-f88335a8e9c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b065d8fd68883dd7247df67336efe9b5062046865b40c4d18eeec239101cff5"}}, "hash": "efc98d43ac258faac8c9ab4ac55318feb92cafca788e43741d1170ec93300c15", "text": "=== New York Mets ===\n\nThe rivalry between the New York Mets and the Phillies has been said to be among the \"hottest\" rivalries in the National League. The two National League East divisional rivals have met each other recently in playoff, division, and wild card races.\nAside from several brawls in the 1980s, the rivalry remained low-key before the 2006 season, as the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time. Since 2006, the teams have battled for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006 and contended in 2007 and 2008, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011. The Phillies' 2007 Eastern Division Title was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with 17 games remaining.\n\n\n=== Pittsburgh Pirates ===\n\nThe rivalry between the Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League. The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered National League play in their fifth season of 1887, four years after the Phillies.The Phillies and the Pirates had remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969\u20131993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s, the Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other in only two series each year and the rivalry has diminished. However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team and regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fuel the rivalry.

The two teams repeatedly battled for control of the division in the early 1980s and mid 1990s. Following the franchise's relocation to Washington DC in 2005; the rivalry increased in geographic tension due to Washington's proximity to Philadelphia. The rivalry quickly spiked in intensity during the 2010s after Nationals team management introduced a campaign to block Phillies fans from overtaking home games. In 2019; star-outfielder Bryce Harper further fueled tensions after signing a 13-year $330 million contract with the Phillies as a free agent. The Nationals later managed to win the 2019 World Series during the first year of Harper's absence. The Phillies currently lead the series 482-445, but the Nationals lead the postseason series; when the Expos managed a 3-2 victory over the Phillies during the 1981 NLDS.\n\n\n=== Historical rivalries ===\n\n\n==== City Series: Philadelphia Athletics ====\n\nThe City Series was the name of a series of baseball games played between the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League and the Phillies that ran from 1903 through 1955. After the A's move to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955, the City Series rivalry came to an end. The teams have since faced each other in Interleague play (since its introduction in 1997) but the rivalry has effectively died in the intervening years since the A's left Philadelphia. In 2014, when the A's faced the Phillies in inter-league play at Oakland Coliseum, the Athletics did not bother to mark the historical connection, going so far as to have a Connie Mack promotion the day before the series while the Texas Rangers were in Oakland.The first City Series was held in 1883 between the Phillies and the American Association's Athletics. When the Athletics first joined the American League, the two teams played each other in a spring and fall series. No City Series was held in 1901 and 1902 due to legal warring between the National and American Leagues.\n\n\n== Roster ==\n\n\n== Team records ==", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61c23310-1db7-44d5-baf1-4b9cbab93f55": {"__data__": {"id_": "61c23310-1db7-44d5-baf1-4b9cbab93f55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "539469fa-4440-4986-8b5e-f7085e8bdbd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "866533a7ff84784688f6aa969f1e9703f835861cfd26eb907088c7ef828f9ef7"}, "2": {"node_id": "944ed052-5e20-4b36-85a8-f88335a8e9c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b065d8fd68883dd7247df67336efe9b5062046865b40c4d18eeec239101cff5"}, "3": {"node_id": "1abf2c54-fd6a-4d9f-824e-b722ea1a8fc9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f64dd9eab0403aa10cf4359b6b4eabeb50b747dc69ccdfc78b2a96f50f6c1756"}}, "hash": "ede11d655782afd9fc588b59eb17a08da832b46514c7380ffab6696f9ac52fe1", "text": "== Team managers ==\n\nOver 126 seasons, the Phillies' franchise has employed 55 managers.

Ed Delahanty was the first, hitting his four in Chicago's West Side Park on July 13, 1896.

This reading program is designed to help students with their literacy skills and comprehension. Phillies Phundamentals is another educational program, offered through after-school and summer camps, that is designed to make learning fun and support academic skills by using baseball.\nThe Phillies celebrate teachers during their annual Teacher Appreciation Night.The \u201cCut Out Overdoses\u201d anti-drug campaign, sponsored by Mothers Against Prescription Drug Abuse (MAPDA) and Emergent Biosolutions, manufacturer of the overdose antagonist Narcan, highlights the drug overdose problem through special communications programs at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Phillies. (There are identical programs supported by both the Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds.) In 2020, the stadium, fan-empty due to the coronavirus pandemic, featured \u201ccut-out\u201d cardboard figures of fans filling the stands. Clicking on one of the silhouettes leads to the anguished story of the overdose death of an individual, written by family members. The story also encourages readers to take a stand by learning more about opioid-reversal medication and making a donation to MAPDA. The site reports that an American dies from an accidental opioid overdose every 15 minutes, over 35,000 people annually.\n\n\n=== Fan support and reputation ===\nPhillies' fans have earned a reputation over the years for their occasional unruly behavior.In the 1960s, radio announcers for visiting teams would frequently report on the numerous fights breaking out in Connie Mack Stadium.Immediately after the final game at the old park, many fans ran onto the field or dislodged parts of the ballpark to take home with them.Later, at Veterans Stadium, the 700 Level gained a reputation for its \"hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness\".Phillies fans are famously known for their reputation for being the \"Meanest Fans in America\".Phillies' fans are known for harsh criticism of their own stars such the 1964 Rookie of the Year Richie Allen and Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt.The fans, however, are just as well known for heckling the visiting team.Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Burt Hooton's poor performance during game three of the 1977 NLCS has often been attributed to the crowd's taunting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8536794d-8d5c-4307-8eb9-2c47c62d64be": {"__data__": {"id_": "8536794d-8d5c-4307-8eb9-2c47c62d64be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "539469fa-4440-4986-8b5e-f7085e8bdbd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "866533a7ff84784688f6aa969f1e9703f835861cfd26eb907088c7ef828f9ef7"}, "2": {"node_id": "509aff0d-53fe-49d0-a7f7-8eb2c338992e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "38a25c8de717c9be4e1b7034c229c04da46ff6c453902108869d52fa80fce3db"}, "3": {"node_id": "737c4b83-a405-4d49-b059-b046f1e8a558", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33bd5b96e30da0a46ae3e4157365b1fc9d12c4dc3f8f393eb3377dfb87e226a6"}}, "hash": "301fd01e2e5efc07ee75e01f9aa1f095610eabfa99c058f49f1d01a2cafd4ad3", "text": "J. D. Drew, the Phillies' first overall draft pick in the amateur draft of 1997, never signed with the Phillies following a contract dispute with the team, instead re-entering the draft the next year to be drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals.Phillies fans were angered over this disrespect and hurled debris, including two D batteries, at Drew during an August 1999 game.Many sportswriters have noted the passionate presence of Phillies fans.Allen Barra wrote that the biggest roar he ever heard from Philadelphia fans was in 1980 when Tug McGraw, in the victory parade after the World Series, told New York fans they could \"take this championship and shove it.\"When the Phillies moved to Veterans Stadium, they hired a group of young ladies to serve as ushers.These women wore maroon-colored outfits featuring hot pants and were called the Hot Pants Patrol.The team also introduced a pair of mascots attired in colonial garb, named Philadelphia Phil and Phyllis.In addition to costumed characters, animated Phil and Phyllis figures mounted on the center-field facade would \"hit\" the Liberty Bell after a Phillies home run.This pair of mascots never achieved any significant level of popularity with fans and were eventually discontinued.In 1978, the team introduced a new mascot, the Phillie Phanatic, who has been called \"baseball's best mascot\", which has been much more successful and has become closely associated with the marketing of the team.In Phillies' fan culture, it is also not unusual to replace an \"f\" with a \"ph\" in words, such as the Phillie Phanatic.The club surpassed 100 consecutive sellouts on August 19, 2010, selling out over 50% of their home games and averaging an annual attendance of over 3.1 million fans since moving to Citizens Bank Park; on April 3, 2011, the team broke the three-game series attendance record at the ballpark, having 136,254 fans attend the opening weekend against the Houston Astros.In 2011 and 2012, the Phillies led the league in attendance with 3,680,718 and 3,565,718 fans, respectively, coming out to watch Phillies baseball.The Phillies now boast active international support groups on social media, with a Philadelphia Phillies' UK Facebook group starting in August 2015 and UK Phillies' Twitter account created in May 2017.In March 2018 a Phillies' France account launched in French.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "737c4b83-a405-4d49-b059-b046f1e8a558": {"__data__": {"id_": "737c4b83-a405-4d49-b059-b046f1e8a558", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "539469fa-4440-4986-8b5e-f7085e8bdbd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "866533a7ff84784688f6aa969f1e9703f835861cfd26eb907088c7ef828f9ef7"}, "2": {"node_id": "8536794d-8d5c-4307-8eb9-2c47c62d64be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "301fd01e2e5efc07ee75e01f9aa1f095610eabfa99c058f49f1d01a2cafd4ad3"}}, "hash": "33bd5b96e30da0a46ae3e4157365b1fc9d12c4dc3f8f393eb3377dfb87e226a6", "text": "== See also ==\nList of Philadelphia Phillies broadcasters\nList of Philadelphia Phillies first-round draft picks\nList of Philadelphia Phillies Opening Day starting pitchers\nList of Philadelphia Phillies seasons\nSports in Philadelphia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGiles, Bill with Doug Myers.
