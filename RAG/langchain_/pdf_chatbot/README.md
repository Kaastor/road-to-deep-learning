This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Prerequisite

- Create index in Pinecone with 1536 dimensions for embeddings in the text-embedding-ada-002 model due to multiple design choices driven by the trade-offs between model complexity, computational efficiency, and predictive performance.
- If it fails try running it twice

## Ingesting data to Pinecone

This script will take the data, vectorizeit, create embeddings and push data to Pinecone.
```bash
tsx -r dotenv/config scripts/ingest-data.ts
```
